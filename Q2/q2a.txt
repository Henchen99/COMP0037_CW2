2. a. Describe what Temporal Difference (TD) methods are. What are their potential
advantages over both Monte Carlo methods and policy and value iteration?
[8 marks]
Learns models of reward and environment. Builds from bootstrapping and Monte Carlo methods. Uses Monte Carlo scheme for non-stationary environments using a bootstrapped estimate of the return which doesn't require a model of a complete episode.

Bootstrapping uses estimates of successor estimates of state and action values --> predicts future returns at a certain state to estimate the return.

Advantages over both
Monte Carlo and PI/VI have to have episodic tasks
- episodes can be very long, or just not episodic 

...over stationary environments
- environments continuously change
