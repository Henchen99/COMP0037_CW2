[6 marks]
On policy
- Learning occurs on the target policy itself
- 'learning by doing'
- Continually estimate for and change some behaviour policy \pi
Off policy
- Learning comes from an alternate policy which is then used to learn the optimal policy
- Kind of works the way that our brains do - similar to 'learning by observation'
